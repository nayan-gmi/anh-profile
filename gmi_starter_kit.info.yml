name: GMI Starter Kit
type: profile
description: 'Kickstart GMI projects with this starter kit.'
core_version_requirement: '^10'

# Optional: Declare your installation profile as a distribution
# This will make the installer auto-select this installation profile.
# The distribution_name property is used in the installer and other places as
# a label for the software being installed.
# distribution:
#   name: gmi starter kit
#   # If you want your distribution to pre-select a language you can specify
#   # the language code, as well. This will prevent the user from selecting
#   # a language code in the user interface. While not recommended for generic
#   # community distributions, this can be very useful for distributions that
#   # are tailored to a language-specific audience (for example government
#   # institutions in a certain country) but also site-specific installation
#   # profiles. Note that this language code will also be used when installing
#   # the site via Drush.
#   #
#   # To set your theme as the theme for the distribution installation uncomment the following:
#   #
#   # install:
#   #   theme: my_theme
#   #   # To redirect to specific URL after profile installation set your finish_url:
#   #   finish_url: ?welcome=1
#   langcode: en
